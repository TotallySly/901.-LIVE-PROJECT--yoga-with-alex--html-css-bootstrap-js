## UX and UI Design

The owner of the website, Alex, has tasked me with designing and implementing a Yoga website and shop. I have been given complete control and autonomy of the design process. This is from initial concept to completion of a live website. I will, however, be in constant dialogue with the client, as she details which aesthetics she does, or does not like.

I have researched various Yoga websites before creating any concepts - of which you can view below. I have come to the conclusion that images need to be large. These the the main attraction to the website. The length of text does vary, but I like a more 'less is more' approach. As such, text will be kept as minimal as possible.

All websites are heavy on promotional items. The website I am creating is for someone who has just started her Yoga teacher journey. We have agreed that sign-ups and promotional items are not at the forefront for her needs at this stage. She would just like some form of online presence to be competitive with smaller Yoga teachers, and to inform users of her weekly classes or events she is hosting.

### Wireframes

I used the Mockflow website and app to create my wireframes. As I am a basic user, I am limited in how I can present my wireframes (something that will be changed as I continue to grow my skills). As such, there is one image that has the wireframe for Desktop as well as Mobile devices. I have not created any wireframes for Tablet devices. That is because the website will try and take most of the aspects from the Desktop design, and if this does not create a nice aesthetic, then I will use the layout for Mobile devices.

**Desktop Devices**

<i>Hero Image</i>

The navigation bar and logo will remain 'sticky' ensuring that the user can navigate with ease. The logo will remain to help create the familiarity between the user and the client.

The hero image will be a carousel of images, using the Bootstrap framework. Each image will be of the client in various yoga poses. The carousel of images will also act as a 'secondary' navigation bar. Each photo will be related to each section of the website with a button to help it stand out.

<i>About Me</i>

This section will have a nice profile photo of the client in the centre of the page. Around the photo will be various different 'About Me' paragraphs.

<i>Classes</i>

This section has been the hardest to plan for. I have come up with an idea of using a 'timeline' style, akin to inspiration from [Jeff Glenn - Panel Timeline](https://codepen.io/jeffglenn/pen/KNYoKa) and [Brad Traversy - 50 JS Projects in 50 Days](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/learn/lecture/23595170#overview). The idea that the the user clicks on the day of the week, and it expands to display information about the client's classes for that day.
